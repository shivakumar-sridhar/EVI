"""Shared test setup.

Two side effects have to be contained for the suite to be safe to run: opening
windows, and touching the printer.

``design_part`` opens a 3D viewer on success, which is right in use and wrong in a
test run — nobody wants a dozen f3d windows during ``pytest``. The stub below is
applied to the name ``server.py`` imported, so ``tests/test_viewer.py`` still
exercises the real launch logic.

The printer is the serious one. A real ``.env`` sits at the repo root pointing at a
real machine on the LAN, so a test that constructs an ``OctoPrintClient`` without
saying otherwise would talk to it. Credentials are therefore replaced suite-wide with
a host that cannot resolve, and tests that want printer behaviour inject an
``httpx2.MockTransport`` explicitly.
