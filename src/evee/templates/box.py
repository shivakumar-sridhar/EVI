"""box_with_lid — a rectangular box with a press-fit capping lid.

Geometry notes (see CLAUDE.md for why these override BUILD_PLAN.md's text):

* **Capping lid.** The lid is a full-outer-dimension plate. Its lip drops *into*
  the cavity, inset from the lid edge by ``wall + clearance``, so the lip's outer
  dimensions plus a clearance gap per side equal the body's inner dimensions.

* **The cavity is a boolean subtraction, not a shell.** With ``fillet=1.0`` and
  ``wall=2.0`` a negative shell offset implies a -1.0mm inner corner radius,
  which OpenCascade only survives via ``Kind.INTERSECTION``. Subtracting an
  explicit inner box is robust and makes the inner dimensions exact — which
  matters, because the lid is dimensioned off them.

* **The lid exports lip-up.** Plate on the bed, lip pointing +Z, so it slices
  without supports.

* **Ports are cut after the fillet.** A port is a rectangular window through one
  wall — for a cable, a connector, or a button. It is subtracted from the
  finished body, so its own edges stay sharp and the vertical fillets are
  untouched. A port never breaks the top rim: material is always left above it,
  which the printer bridges.

* **Standoffs are added last, and their screw holes are blind.** A standoff is a
  cylindrical post on the cavity floor that a PCB sits on. Its hole stops short
  of the floor, so a standoff never perforates the base, and the post itself
  is sunk slightly into the floor so the union has no coincident faces. Posts
  print without support — they rise straight off the floor in print pose.

* **A floor hole is the one thing that does go through.** ``floor_holes`` cuts
  plain cylinders through the base, open on the inside and on the outside — for a
  magnet, a sensor window, a shaft or a cable gland. Everything else in this
  template deliberately leaves the base solid, so this is opt-in, is kept clear of
  the standoffs, and leaves a margin of floor between itself and the wall root.
  Printed flat on the bed a hole in the floor needs no support and no bridging;
  the first layer simply has a ring in it.
