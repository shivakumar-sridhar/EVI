"""MCP server — the product boundary.

Everything above this file is the user's choice of client and model: Claude Code,
OpenCode, Cline, a voice shim. Everything below is ours. That asymmetry decides
where the rules live.

**The client's model is not trusted to be well-behaved.** The original plan leaned
on constrained decoding to stop a model inventing a parameter; we do not control an
arbitrary client's decoder, so ``extra="forbid"`` and the templates' cross-field
``_validate()`` are the only real gate. Every tool here validates before it builds.

**Tool descriptions are the portable ``CLAUDE.md``.** They ship with the server and
every client reads them; none of them read ``CLAUDE.md``. So the house rules — outer
dimensions, defaults from ``config/defaults.toml``, templates as a fixed whitelist —
are written into the descriptions below rather than assumed.

**Error messages are an API.** They are the client model's only feedback signal for
self-correction, so they must name the offending value. :func:`_describe_error`
exists to keep that true across the MCP boundary.

**Design, slice and print are separate tools, deliberately.** ``design_part`` opens the
model in a viewer and stops; ``slice_part`` takes an STL path and stops; ``start_print``
is its own call and demands a confirmation only a human can give. Nothing chains those
three, because the human approval between them is the whole point — a combined tool
would let a model skip a gate simply by choosing the shorter call.

**Uploading is inside ``start_print``, by explicit decision — 2026-08-12.** There was a
separate ``upload_gcode`` tool and it was removed at the owner's request, which also
restores ``BUILD_PLAN.md`` Phase 5's original signature. The cost was named and
accepted: the human no longer sees the file reach the printer before it commits, so
``bed_confirmed_clear`` is the only thing left between a tool call and a moving machine.
Every Python guard survived the change, and the two OctoPrint calls are still separate
requests with ``print=false`` on the upload. Do not fold slicing in as well.

**The print tools are thin.** Their guards live in :mod:`evee.printer` as Python
refusals, because a rule written only in a tool description is a rule the next client
can talk its way past. What is written here is the same rule stated for the model's
benefit, so it does not have to learn by being refused.

``cancel_print`` **is** a tool as of 2026-08-12, reversing the decision recorded here
before it. The objection was that a model could end an eight-hour print on a misread
sentence; the answer is an explicit ``confirmed`` flag checked with ``is not True``,
the same shape as ``bed_confirmed_clear``, so a misread sentence is not enough. What
made it worth having is that a bare cancel leaves the nozzle over the ruined part with
the plate unreachable — so the tool parks the head, which the button on the machine
does not do.

Parking is the only G-code this package emits, and it is a module constant in
:mod:`evee.printer`. No tool here takes a command string, and none should: a freeform
G-code path would end the property that this server can only do the things it
documents.

Parametric CAD for 3D printing. You pick a vetted template and fill its parameters;
the server builds the geometry.

There is no freeform geometry path. If no template fits the request, say so and stop —
do not approximate with a template that does not fit.

Workflow, with a human decision between every step:

  0. design_history(...)       - has this part been designed before? If the request
     touches anything that already exists ("the mount", "make the holes bigger",
     "same but 8mm"), start here and take the previous version's params. Do NOT
     reconstruct parameters from an STL while the ledger has them: a mesh cannot
     tell you which values were typed and which were defaulted.
  1. list_templates()          - what exists, and each template's parameter schema
  2. design_part(...)          - builds STLs and opens them in a 3D viewer.
     Pass name= so the design is recorded under it. Iterating on an existing part
     means passing the SAME name it is already filed under.
  3. ** GATE 1: the human approves the shape, or asks for changes **
     Changes mean calling design_part() again with adjusted parameters. Iterate here
     as many times as it takes; this step is cheap and reversible.
  4. slice_part(stl_path)      - only after the human has approved the design.
     Normally this is design_part's plate, which prints every part in one job.
  5. ** GATE 2: the human sees the time and filament cost and approves **
  6. get_printer_status()      - confirm the machine is idle and connected
  7. ** GATE 3: the human physically looks at the build plate and says it is clear **
  8. start_print(gcode_path, bed_confirmed_clear=True)  - uploads it and prints it

calibrate_bed(bed_confirmed_clear=True) is optional and sits outside this sequence.
It measures the bed once so later prints skip a multi-minute probe. Suggest it when
get_printer_status says recommend_recalibration, and never run it unasked: it moves
the machine for minutes and needs the same bed confirmation a print does.

House rules:
- Dimensions in a user's request are OUTER unless they say otherwise.
- Omitted parameters resolve from config/defaults.toml (2.0mm walls, 0.25mm press-fit
  clearance, 1.0mm edge fillet). Do not invent defaults; leave a parameter out.
- Always report the resolved inner dimensions alongside the outer ones. design_part()
  returns both, plus a spec sentence written for reading back to the user.

Each gate is a separate turn. Do not call two of these tools in one turn: the human
has not seen the previous result yet, so there is no approval to act on. Waiting is
the one thing this workflow requires of you.

Gate 3 is different in kind from the others. A print heats a nozzle to 200C and runs
for hours, possibly in an empty room, and a plate with the last part still stuck to it
wrecks the print and can damage the machine. Nobody but a human can check that, so
bed_confirmed_clear must come from a person who has looked at the plate and said so.
Never infer it, never carry it over from an earlier print, and never set it from a
voice transcript — ask through a channel the person is actually looking at. If you
have not asked in this conversation and heard a clear yes, you do not have it.

start_print uploads and starts in one call, so that confirmation is the last thing
standing between you and a running machine. There is no separate upload step to pause
at. Ask, wait for the answer, then call it.

Do not suggest starting a print when the person has said they are going out, going to
bed, or is away from the building. Offer to have it ready for when they are back.

Stopping a print: cancel_print(confirmed=True). It throws the part away and cannot be
undone, so ask in plain words first — "how is it going?" and "this looks wrong" are not
requests to cancel. It parks the head afterwards so the plate can be cleaned. Afterwards
the plate has a failed part on it, so the next print needs a fresh Gate 3.
